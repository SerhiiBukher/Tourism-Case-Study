In this case study, the core aim is to structure and prepare data for a company so that the analyst team can produce comprehensive reports, visualizations, and statistical models aimed at broadening the companyâ€™s market reach. The emphasis is placed on examining inbound and outbound tourism information at both the country and continent levels for the year 2014. The project consists of three main tasks tied to creating the cleaned_tourism, final_tourism, and nocountryfound tables.

The first task involves reorganizing the initial tourism dataset according to specific requirements, resulting in the cleaned_tourism table. Next, the second task merges the reorganized tourism data with the country_info table, yielding the final_tourism table that retains only matching records. Lastly, the third task calls for generating the nocountryfound table, which lists distinct countries without any corresponding entries in country_info. The SAS program successfully meets all these data requirements.
